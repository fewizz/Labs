Most individuals don't think about numbers, or numerical representations of quantity,
but they play a major part in everyday life. To be sure, numbers determine the time individuals
will wake up in the morning, how much money employees earn per hour, what day of the year it is,
and much, much more. Additionally, numbers impact everyday living on a much smaller scale.
In the grocery store, for instance, numbers determine products' prices, the amount of a product
available for purchase, how much money will need to be paid for products, and a whole lot else.
